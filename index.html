            <p>We were driving from Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, to Mitrovica, a city in the country's north. Cut in half physically by the River Ibar, Mitrovica is also divided politically and ethnically.</p> 

             <p>Before war broke out in 1999 between Kosovo and Yugoslavia - comprising only Serbia and Montengro by then - Mitrovica was one of the most prosperous cities in the Balkans and the backbone of its economy was the mining industry. The Trepca lead and zinc mines are the second biggest in Europe and once provided 20,000 jobs in the area. </p>

            <p>But conflict divided the city. The area south of the river is inhabited by a majority of ethnic Albanians, the north is home to the largest number of ethnic Serbs in Kosovo. It has been semi-autonomous since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008.</p>

           <p>Since the split, the mines have closed and the city's economy has atrophied.</p>

      			<p style="padding-top: 20px;"><b>It was mid-April,</b> and we were on our way to a political rally in the city's north side, taking place two weeks before the Serbian parliamentary election. And so, apparently, was Seselj.</p> 

      			<p>Throughout the Yugoslav Wars, Seselj was at the forefront of calls for a Greater Serbia, a quasi-mythical vision uniting ethnic Serbs into a state based on Serbia's 14th century empire. The policy advocated annexing swathes of Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Kosovo - implementing ethnic cleansing to do so.</p> 

      			<p>His SDS played a role in helping Slobadan Milosevic to power, by scooping up right-wing votes and cooperating with him in parliament. In March this year Seselj was acquitted of war crimes including ethnic cleansing, torture and murder by the Hague.</p> 

          	<p>The verdict has <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21696145-international-tribunal-creating-confusing-standards-war-crimes-and-politicians-vojislav" target="_blank"> proved controversial</a> because it ruled that he cannot be held responsible for the men who acted out his rhetoric, as they were under the control of the Yugoslavian Army. That some were also part of his own militia was not enough for the International Criminal Tribunal to convict him.</p>

          	<p>Since the trial, Seselj was back on the campaign trail, and he was targeting Mitrovica's Serbs for votes. He'd be travelling in a car boot because, despite his acquittal, the Kosovo government had made it clear he was <i>persona non grata</i> and would be arrested on-sight in the country. We parked in the city centre and walked to the contested bridge that crosses the Ibar.</p>

      	<p>“I'm not going across, man,” said Xili. “You can go, I'll wait here”.</p> 

      	<p>Xili had crossed over into Serbian territory a few times before, but today he said it was too risky. There was real danger of being recognised as an Albanian and assaulted.</p>

Officials tried to play it down as a “series of unfortunate events” that had “upset people”.</p>

    		<p>In the end, Seselj didn't show up at the rally, addressing it by phone instead. The police locked down the northern side of Mitrovica, he claimed, because of fears he would turn up.</p>

    		<p>At the protest, the SRS spoke out against Serbian Prime Minister Aleksander Vucic and President, Tomislav Nikolic. Both are ex-members of the party and former allies of Seselj. Once he was indicted for war crimes they jumped ship and formed the Serbian Progressive Party [SNS] and now they lead Serbia’s government in Belgrade. </p>

    		<p>“In the name of government of Republic of Serbia he [President of Serbia, Tomislav Nikolic] guaranteed that you will live better, that by setting barricades [against Kosovo] you will get a better life and since then what happened? He lost the battle with Kosovo. He played his dirty game and lost it,” an SRS agitator boomed from the stage. </p>

      <p><b>The Radical Party</b> say Vucic and Nikolic have abandoned Kosovo’s Serbs in their hopes of joining the EU. In order for Serbia’s accession to be considered, its relations with Kosovo must be normalised, which means accepting its sovereignty and dismantling the parallel government that has been established in the Serbian areas of northern Kosovo.   </p>

      <p>For Mitrovica’s Serb nationalists this is the final straw. On one hand sits the perception of Kosovo as part of the Greater Serbia and on the other, fears of being left behind as Belgrade chases the carrot of European Union membership. </p>

      <p>Seselj and the Radical Party play on this dichotomy. Whilst the SDS has collapsed within Serbia - losing all its seats in 2012 - it still retains influence in the autonomous assembly set up to represent Serbs in Kosovo who refuse to recognise its independence. The Putin banners flying in the north side of town are an indication of where the Serb nationalists think their homeland's loyalties should lie. </p>

      <p>“I think their ideology is stupid,” said Milos Timotijevic, a 27-year-old Kosovo Serb, who works for a local NGO. He says parties like the SDS are getting weaker all the time. “It is rhetoric from the 1990s and not for the 21st century, but they live on voters who don't have their own jobs or money.” <p>

      <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">On the south side of the river, optimism has faded after the initial euphoria of the independent Kosovo; it was not a panacea for the area's social and economic problems. The north of the city has many of the same problems, which breeds anger and resentment. Lingering ill-feeling means that for some Serbs there is only one philosophy: <i>Kosovo je Srbija</i>.</p>

        <p><b>Nationalism on both sides of the river</b>, and wounds still smarting from the war, have kept the city divided. The decaying sites of Trepca are inexorably linked to this, because both sides lay claim to the potentially lucrative mines.</p>

        <p>“In the eyes of Kosovo Serbs and the management of Trepca North, the mines belonged to the Serbian government, who would have to sanction any investment or public-private partnership,” said Ian Cliff, British ambassador to Kosovo between 2011 and 2015. </p>

        <p>“The Kosovo Albanians, Kosovo government and the management of Trepca South viewed the mines as an asset on the territory of Kosovo that therefore belonged to Kosovo.” </p>

As Milosevic took power in Yugoslavia in 1989, Trepca fell under Serbian control. </p>

       <p>“Every day we had to face struggles,” said Avdi Uka, who worked at Trepca for 27 years, until he was fired in 1989. “Getting put in jail for no reason, nationalistic rallies for Serbs and physical as well as psychological violence.” </p>

       <p>In February 1989, Trepca’s Albanian miners went on strike to protest worsening conditions, and Avdi was one of the organisers. Although Kosovo would not fight for independence until 10 years later, it was one of the first signs of unrest as Yugoslavia began to unravel.</p>

       <p>“We went down into the mine for eight days and eight nights and stayed there as a protest. On the second of March they arrested me and I was in jail for 14 months for organising the strike,” he said. </p>

       <p>Around 1200 people were put on trial and punished. In August 1990 all Albanians were kicked out of Trepca as part of Milosevic’s regime. They would not return until after the Kosovo War, by which time ten years of conflict and neglect meant Stari Trg, Trepca’s biggest mine, had fallen into ruination.</p>

       <p>“The conditions we found right after we came back after the war were terrible,” said Bilil Nezir, who used to be a miner, but now works in the kitchens at Trepca. “Thank God we arrived just in time after the war. We saved the mine from complete demolition.” </p>

       <p><b>The main mine,</b> Stari Trg, was flooded during the war. Floatation devices - where ore is separated from the valueless rock attached to it - failed. After the conflict, the Kosovo Force [KFOR] peacekeepers split the opposing sides; the northern sites fell under Serbian control and the Albanians took control of the south. Recognising the potential value of Trepca, KFOR instructed the Albanians to repair the flooded mine. An impasse between the sides has remained since. </p>

       <p>Some miners still work around Mitrovica, but operations are small-scale. The majority of the 40 mines that make up the Trepca complex sit in Albanian territory, but a couple are on the Serbian side. Most crucially, so is the main processing plant at Zvecan. </p>

        <p>“We currently have 750 people who work in the mine,” said Bilil. “Unfortunately the way we work now is not even half the job we used to do because the factory where the minerals got separated is up in the north and it’s not under our management.” </p>

        <p>Kosovo's Independent Commission for Mines and Minerals has said the <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-kosovo-mines-idUKTRE4B803620081209" target="_blank">value of Trepca's deposits</a> could be as much as 10 billion euros, but without cooperation from from Zvecan in the north, which melts down the zinc and lead ore into a marketable product, the mine can only operate at a fraction of its potential. </p>

        <p>Zvecan officially closed in August 2000. The UN shut down it down after the war, with the assistance of NATO troops, citing its environmental and health risk. Lead levels in the air were believed to be 125 times higher than European Union standards.</p>

        <p>There are plans to modernise the plant, which would reduce its environmental impact. Costs would be offset by the huge mineral wealth of the mines, but with Trepca’s ownership still unresolved this is impossible.</p>

        <p>Last year, in an effort to take control of the mines, the Kosovo government announced it would attempt to <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/04/set-the-trojan-horse-on-fire-kosovo-serbia-protests-mining/" target="_blank">nationalise Trepca</a>, later putting the plans on hold because of Serbia’s claim to the complex. There were Echoes of 1989 as riots in Pristina ensued and Trepca’s remaining miners went on strike again. </p>

        <p>Serbian prime minister Alexander Vucic responded indignantly to Kosovo’s plans during a recent visit to Leposavic, in the Mitrovica district, claiming his government would never allow Trepca to fall into Pristina’s hands. </p>

        <p>“What we… fear is an attempt [by the Pristina authorities] in the future to approve a specific law with which to transform Trepca into the public property of the so-called Republic of Kosovo,” Vucic told a rally in Leposavic on 4 April, as reported by <a href="http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/vucic-serbia-will-fight-over-trepca-04-04-2016" target="_blank"> BalkanInsight.com</a>.“Without a doubt, we will stand up to [this] and fight it politically.” </p>

        <p>Kosovo's nationalisation of Trepca failed, but privatisation of the mine has not succeeded either. Ian Cliff says that during his time as ambassador to Kosovo, the perception on one hand of past Serbian investment in Trepca and on the other of the role of the Trepca miners in striking against the Milosevic regime meant that nationalist feelings on both sides were bound up with Trepca.</p>

        <p>“This made it difficult for Governments and investors to take rational business decisions about the future of the complex,” he said. 

        <p>The mines once provided 70 per cent of Kosovo's GDP, but the prospect of it reaching that level again is unlikely whilst both sides are entrenched. Cliff thinks that the mines could be viable, but it would require substantial investment, and a partnership with an international metals group. </p>

        <p style="padding-bottom: 5%;">“It would make a limited number of skilled jobs secure, while almost certainly requiring an early retirement scheme for some existing employees,” he said. “In the long term this would benefit Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo Serbs in Mitrovica and northern Kosovo.” </p>

          <p><b>Since Trepca’s closure</b>, nothing has been found to fill the void left in Mitrovica’s economy. The city’s <a href="https://citiesintransition.net/fct-cities/mitrovica/" target="_blank">official unemployment figure</a> is 65 per cent, compared to 30 per cent nationally. In a country that is officially Europe's youngest - half the population is under 25 - the impact is plain to see. On the weekday I visited, the city was full of young people crowded into cafe terraces, drinking 50 cent coffee and smoking the day away.</p>

          <p class="uk-hidden-touch" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">“In general it’s hard to live without working, but especially here,” said Samir Begu, a 37-year-old Kosovo Albanian who I met at the aptly named Miner’s Pub, in the centre of Mitrovica. “Unemployment is very high. They [the government] force you into getting involved with crime. There are no public institution jobs, you can’t get such a job. And working for private companies, for 90 cents an hour, you have to work 11 hours a day.”</p>

      <p><b>Samir used to be a carpenter</b>, but depressed wages made him turn to crime, such as robbing shops, dealing drugs and stealing cars. Since declaring independence, Kosovo has been unable to export anything to or via Serbia. Ironically this has brought the two sides together, as Samir has worked with people from the north to smuggle goods across the border.</p>

      <p>“It’s not the only way, obviously,” he confessed. “A lot of people work 16 hours a day at an honest job and get paid ten euros.”</p>

      <p>Samir’s dad worked at Trepca, as a welder on the railways. When he was growing up, his dad kept him and 10 other family members comfortably with his salary. He says Trepca’s closure meant he couldn't get an education, because his dad couldn’t afford to send him to school after he was forced to leave his job. </p>

      <p>“We were the last generation growing up under the last breaths of communism in these territories,” he said. “When it was the blossoming time for the younger generation our parents got fired from their workplaces.”</p>

      <p>“The damage that was done shutting it down, it wasn’t just local damage. It was considered the back garden of Yugoslavia.” </p>

      <p>Serbs in Mitrovica face many of the same challenges as people in the south, but this is made worse because they are a minority in the city. Milica Radovanovic, a 22-year-old law student explains that the issue of living in a divided city is overshadowed by bigger problems such as corruption, unemployment and people trafficking. </p>

      <p>“Every time I think that there are people in this world who do not have enough to eat or drink I find that there are bigger problems [than living in a divided city] - not only in the world - but also in my community.”</p>

  	<p>She says that Serbs in Mitrovica have to live with the consequences of losing a war that she’s only just old enough to remember. Animosity between the two sides is still strong enough to keep her from travelling to the south. </p> 

  	<p>“It is maybe irrational, but that fear is still present,” she said. “I went [to the south] a few times and nothing bad happened, but I still do not feel safe enough to walk freely in places where Albanians are the majority.”</p>

  	<p>Division is still a part of daily life in Mitrovica, and Trepca encapsulates it. Both sides suffer the longer they stay apart. For 34-year-old Gzim Ferati, Trepca's closure, and the lack of opportunities for young people this has brought about, is compounded by government corruption.</p>

    <p>“A lot of our officials are corrupt,” he said. “Twenty regional mayors are under investigation. One of them is in jail for 13 years and he’s still the mayor.”</p>

    <p>Gzim has been unemployed for three years, after working as a manager in a factory. He says that compared to when Trepca was open, conditions in Mitrovica are miserable now. He and Samir agree that there is only one solution to their predicament if the situation in Mitrovica doesn't change. </p>

    <p style="padding-bottom: 5%;">“I’m terrified by the future,” said Samir. “There is no hope of getting a job or building a proper life here. If I can’t find a solution my only option will be to move to Europe however I can.”</p>
